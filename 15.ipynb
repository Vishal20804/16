    "Primary Key: A Primary Key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Primary Keys are used to uniquely identify records in a table and ensure that each record can be uniquely identified and accessed. Primary Keys are typically used as a reference point for other tables to establish relationships, and they must satisfy the following properties:\n",
    "Uniqueness: Each value in the Primary Key column(s) must be unique, meaning no two rows in the table can have the same value for the Primary Key column(s).\n",
    "Non-null: Each value in the Primary Key column(s) must be non-null, meaning it cannot be empty or null.\n",
    "Immutable: The value of the Primary Key column(s) should not change after it has been assigned to a record.\n",
    "Foreign Key: A Foreign Key is a column in a table that refers to the Primary Key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, where the Foreign Key column in one table refers to the Primary Key of another table. Foreign Keys are used to maintain referential integrity and ensure that data in one table is related to data in another table. Foreign Keys typically represent relationships between tables, such as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "For example, in a table named \"orders\", a column named \"customer_id\" can be designated as a Foreign Key, referring to the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between the \"orders\" table and the \"customers\" table, where each order is associated with a specific customer by referencing the Primary Key of the \"customers\" table."
